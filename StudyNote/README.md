## About This Repository
This repository contains comprehensive study notes for the **Data Structures** course. Unlike standard lecture slides, these notes are restructured for **deep understanding**, featuring:
- **Visualizations** of data flows and memory layouts.
- **Deep Dives** into implementation details (C/C++ & STL).
- **Complexity Analysis** (Time & Space).
- **Comparison Tables** (e.g., Array vs. Linked List, BFS vs. DFS).

## Table of Contents

### Part I: Linear Data Structures
Fundamental structures where data elements are arranged sequentially.

| Topic | Key Concepts & Highlights | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Arrays** | • Static vs. Dynamic Memory (`malloc`/`realloc`)<br>• STL `std::vector` vs. `std::array`<br>• Sorting & Searching Basics | [View Note](StudyNote/Array.md) |
| **Linked Lists** | • Singly, Doubly, & Circular Lists<br>• Pointer Manipulation & Memory Management<br>• **Comparison**: Array vs. Linked List | [View Note](./LinkedLists.md) |
| **Stacks & Queues** | • LIFO vs. FIFO Principles<br>• Implementation (Array vs. Linked List)<br>• Circular Queue Logic & Applications | [View Note](./Stacks_Queues.md) |

### Part II: Non-Linear Data Structures & Algorithms
Advanced structures for complex relationships and efficient retrieval.

| Topic | Key Concepts & Highlights | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|**Trees** | • Binary Trees, BST, & AVL Trees<br>• Traversal Algorithms (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order)<br>• Tree Height & Depth Analysis | [View Note](./Trees.md) |
| **Heaps** | • Max Heap vs. Min Heap<br>• Priority Queue Implementation<br>• Heap Sort & Array Representation | [View Note](./Heaps.md) |
| **Graphs** | • Adjacency Matrix vs. Adjacency List<br>• Traversal Algorithms: BFS (Queue) vs. DFS (Stack)<br>• **Comparison**: Tree vs. Graph | [View Note](./Graphs.md) |
| **Hashing** | • Hash Functions & Indexing<br>• Collision Resolution (Chaining vs. Open Addressing)<br>• Load Factor & Resizing | [View Note](./Hashing.md) |

##  Key Comparisons
Quick reference for major trade-offs discussed in the notes.

- **Memory Layout**: [Contiguous (Arrays)] vs. [Non-Contiguous (Linked Lists)]
- **Traversal**: [BFS (Level Order)] vs. [DFS (Backtracking)]
-  **Priority Management**: [Heap (Order Property)] vs. [BST (Search Property)]
-   **Storage**: [Adjacency Matrix (Dense)] vs. [Adjacency List (Sparse)]

## Motivation & Methodology

Although English is not my native language, I have intentionally curated these notes in English. This approach serves a dual purpose: **mastering Data Structures** and **enhancing my technical English proficiency** for future academic and professional endeavors.

To ensure a comprehensive and structured understanding, these notes are synthesized from:
1.  **Lecture Materials**: Core concepts from CS203A slides.
2.  **AI Assistance (Google Gemini)**: Used to organize logic, format content, and fill in knowledge gaps, ensuring no critical details are missed.

Unlike standard lecture slides, the notes in this repository are restructured for **deep understanding**, featuring:
- **Visualizations** of data flows and memory layouts.
- **Deep Dives** into implementation details (C/C++ & STL).
- **Comparison Tables** (e.g., Array vs. Linked List, BFS vs. DFS).
