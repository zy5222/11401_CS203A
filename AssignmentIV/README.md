# Homework Assignment IV: Hash Function Design & Observation (C/C++ Version)

This assignment focuses on the design and observation of hash functions using C/C++. 
Students are expected to implement and analyze the behavior of hash functions, 
evaluate their efficiency, and understand their applications in computer science.

## My Hash Function
### Integer Keys 
- Formula / pseudocode:
  ```text
  [Your implementation here]
  ```
- Rationale: [Explain your design choices and how they minimize collisions.]

### Non-integer Keys
- Formula / pseudocode:
  ```text
  [Your implementation here]
  ```
- Rationale: [Explain your approach and its effectiveness for non-integer keys.]

## Experimental Setup
- Table sizes tested (m): 10, 11, 37
- Test dataset:
  - Integers: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60
  - Strings: "cat", "dog", "bat", "cow", "ant", "owl", "bee", "hen", "pig", "fox"
- Compiler: GCC and G++
- Standard: C23 and C++23

## Results
| Table Size (m) | Index Sequence         | Observation              |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 10             | 1, 2, 3, 4, ...        | Pattern repeats every 10 |
| 11             | 10, 0, 1, 2, ...       | More uniform             |
| 37             | 20, 21, 22, 23, ...    | Near-uniform             |

## Compilation, Build, Execution, and Output

### Compilation
- Command for C:
  ```bash
  gcc -std=c23 -o hash_function main.c
  ```
- Command for C++:
  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++23 -o hash_function_cpp main.cpp
  ```

### Make Binary
- Use the following `Makefile` to automate the build process:
  ```makefile
  all:
      gcc -std=c23 -o hash_function main.c
      g++ -std=c++23 -o hash_function_cpp main.cpp
  clean:
      rm -f hash_function hash_function_cpp
  ```

### Execution
- Run the compiled binary:
  ```bash
  ./hash_function
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  ./hash_function_cpp
  ```

### Result Snapshot
- Example output for integers:
  ```
  === Hash Function Observation (C Version) ===

  -----------------
  21      1
  22      2
  ...

  === Table Size m = 11 ===
  Key     Index
  -----------------
  21      10
  22      0
  ...

  === Table Size m = 37 ===
  Key     Index
  -----------------
  21      21
  22      22
  ...

  === Hash Function Observation (C++ Version) ===

  === Table Size m = 10 ===

  -----------------
  21      1
  22      2
  ...

  === Table Size m = 11 ===

  -----------------
  21      10
  22      0
  ...

  === Table Size m = 37 ===
  Key     Index
  -----------------
  21      21
  22      22
  ...
  ```

- Example output for strings:
  ```
  === String Hash (m = 10) ===
  Key     Index
  -----------------
  cat     0
  dog     0
  ...

  === String Hash (m = 11) ===
  Key     Index
  -----------------
  cat     0
  dog     0
  ...

  === String Hash (m = 37) ===
  Key     Index
  -----------------
  cat     0
  dog     0
  ...
  ```

- Observations: Outputs align with the analysis, showing better distribution with prime table sizes.
- Example output for integers:
  ```
  Hash table (m=10): [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]
  Hash table (m=11): [10, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  Hash table (m=37): [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, ...]
  ```
- Example output for strings:
  ```
  Hash table (m=10): ["cat", "dog", "bat", "cow", "ant", ...]
  Hash table (m=11): ["fox", "cat", "dog", "bat", "cow", ...]
  Hash table (m=37): ["bee", "hen", "pig", "fox", "cat", ...]
  ```
- Observations: Outputs align with the analysis, showing better distribution with prime table sizes.

## Analysis
- Prime vs non-prime `m`: Prime table sizes generally result in better distribution and fewer collisions.
- Patterns or collisions: Non-prime table sizes tend to produce repetitive patterns, leading to more collisions.
- Improvements: Use a prime table size and a well-designed hash function to enhance distribution.

## Reflection
1. Designing hash functions requires balancing simplicity and effectiveness to minimize collisions.
2. Table size significantly impacts the uniformity of the hash distribution, with prime sizes performing better.
3. The design using a prime table size and a linear transformation formula produced the most uniform index sequence.
